Family Dependents			As someone with a family, the support I receive isn't enough. The hardest part is having to pay ~$7000 per year for my wife and child's health insurance, which I get through UC SHIP. I should point out that the fact that it is possible for me to get them coverage (even though I have to pay &gt;1/5 of my stipend for it) means that I can't get assistance through the ACA. This is a massive difficulty for my family, and comes close to pushing us over the edge.   		Unknown

I lived both on and off campus. I don't feel comfortable sharing a bathroom or living with 2+ people. I don't want to spend hours on my commute driving and not being able to find parking on campus just to be able to afford a private room&bath (that would still be ~50% of my income just in rent).  As an international student, I am only allowed to work on campus and max %50. Thresources.is means I can't supplement my income with other sources.  I'm not eligible for most fellowships and grants (especially being in non-stem). I can't see my family as easily because it costs a fortune to fly across the world. So sometimes it's a choice between visiting home vs. going to a conference (vacation? don't even mention). Fortunately there have been TAships available over the summers, yet we still don't get paid until Nov1. So if I go home for in SS2, I'm technically broke because of the travel expenses+moving expenses+ living costs for until Nov.

It hurts being charged this much for rent when I'm just trying to go to school and live. San Diego is beautiful and I understand why it's so expensive, however how can I afford to live here and focus on research at the same time. I have honestly thought about picking up some weekend side work in order to make ends meet, which would only delay/weaken my PhD. There are people who triple up to a room and even rent out their living rooms to make ends meet. I refuse to do this and am therefore paying the price. It's not fun worrying about such things, especially when the landlord has said he may raise the rent to more closely match ""the new market value."" Also when looking at students stated income, note the difference between gross and net, some may put down gross, some net. I put down net so you could better appreciate the reality of low pay when you're living in one of the most expensive cities in the US. Thank you for hearing us out."		Unknown

However, for me it is not possible to save any of that money, which makes paying rent and buying food in the summer impossible unless you find summer employment. As an International student, I am not allowed to work off campus, and it is very difficult to find summer employment on campus, so I'm worried about my financial situation for these next few years. I am currently making enough to pay for my most basic needs during the year, but there have been many times when I have had less than $500 total in checking and savings, which means I have been unable to afford unexpected expenses and necessary medical treatments.

If I were an international student without a working visa then being part of the graduate program at ucsd would almost be a non-option; I wouldn't put myself in such a precarious financial position. Everyone wants more money- I don't think that this is overall UCSD's responsibility- American citizens can work outside of school to support themselves; international students on the other hand cannot, and so they should probably be provided some kind of extra support to make up for the fact that, in order to obey their visa/u.s. working law, they are less independent and able to provide for themselves financially during a graduate program. These are my observations of the comparative financial struggles within our graduate program.

Without a second income, a UCSD grad student parent can not make it financially at UCSD. However, when both parents work, someone has to watch the child. Childcare costs are the biggest for a family with pre-school age kids. COLA 4 UCSD. COLA 4 ALL. Or we will have to leave school. Many parents (esp. single parents) have left school due to the financial burdens. UCSD has increased campus housing dramatically in the span of my education here (5-6 yrs). The GSA should take an active role in advocating for the students and paying attn. Why we are not hearing anything directly from the GSA - what is the purpose of this organization (to which we pay money)?

It is more difficult for us to rent places off campus. Many of us don't have cars and can't afford to buy one upon immediate arrival because of the currency exchange rate and therefore have to live close to public transportation or to school, which makes it all the more costly. TA salaries and/or our stipends are not sufficient enough for us to live a decent life and focus on our research. I am sick of being constantly worried about housing. I also find it really discriminatory that some students have SHORE and thus secure housing. They are at great financial and psychological advantage. HDH's `families first` policy is just as equally upsetting. Single graduate students (including the graduate student who refuse society's hetero-patriarchal monogamous lifestyle) are just as valuable as the married ones. UCSD should not admit more graduate students than they can accommodate. We feel left out and discriminated against by the University as international students.

I have SHORE, which was supposed to be a benefit to me for coming from a disadvantaged background. SHORE has been a blessing and curse in recent years because I count on it for housing security, but the lack of warning about dramatic rent increases (&gt;3%) without a similar pay increase has meant financial insecurity in order to hold onto my housing security. I no longer have a car or can afford a car, meaning my quality of life in San Diego has significantly decreased. Luckily, I can walk to campus, so even when we don't have access to shuttles or MTS buses, I can get most of the things I need. Please help push UCSD housing to post rates at least a year in advance so that we can better plan for long term budgeting. We don't get paid anywhere near the average or median income for UTC or La Jolla, so it is ridiculous to say the on-campus housing rent should be based on below UTC or La Jolla market value. Alternatively, UCSD could pay graduate students a more livable wage. Underrepresented students who need to potentially provide family support or who lack family support have a harder time here generally, continually increasing the cost of living by raising the ""cheap"" on-campus housing rent and increasing student fees (for things like the MTS bus pass) impact some students disproportionally.

While UCSD is building more graduate housing, it is significantly more expensive and significantly worse in terms of space, storage, layout, etc (you cannot even fit both a desk and dresser in your bedroom). While UCSD HDH says they are trying to meet housing demand for graduate students, knocking down the nice and affordable (+ more family friendly) housing to build complexes that have as much space as an undergrad dorm (and clearly not designed for someone to comfortably live 12 months/yr) and are hundreds of dollars more per month is not helpful to most of us and in fact prices a lot of us out. Therefore, if I did not live in Mesa or OMS, I would have a worse quality of life and higher cost of living. I strongly recommend UCSD consider how many graduate students actually fill the new grad housing units before they continue knocking down the more affordable units. I personally think that they won't be able to fill them with graduate students. Additionally, HDH keeps raising the rent to cover the costs of building more housing, so I really think they should stop and wait a while before taking on more debt and raising rent further just for grad students to be priced out of housing.

Living on campus is slightly cheaper, but we are only allowed 2 years oh on-campus housing. I'm already done with my 2 years, but I still have 3 years of my PhD to go. As PhD students, we are under constant stress, and not being able to have affordable housing and pay off all our bills is one of the main causes of stress. All PhD students should have on-campus housing granted for their entire program. And keep in mind $915 to share the house with another 5 students is NOT the meaning of affordable. Rita Atkinson is an affordable housing, but my fellow graduate students are being kicked out of there to make room to undergrads, and the new replacement is Nuevo West, which is much much more expansive. In addition, the HDH of Mesa Nueva claims that parking is included in the rent, however, with 2 new communities (Nuevo West and East) and only half of a new parking structure dedicated to residential purposes, there is not going to be enough parking spots for everyone.

Without them I would not have been able to at all afford my graduate program or cost of living while in school. It is only because of the tuition remission/health insurance waiver that comes with the TAship and stipend that I am able to remain in my program. La Jolla is a very expensive place to live as a student but living farther away from campus is not possible due to the time/expense of a long commute. I am managing to make things work right now because of my TAship but financial insecurity has caused me a lot of anxiety about keeping up with my financial obligations.

The choice therefore is either to live further away in a cheaper neighborhood and pay for a car/insurance to commute, or live closer and pay more in rent/utilities. These tend to equal the same cost. This does not begin to factor in other financial obligations of students like student loans, which makes graduate school boarder unaffordable for many individuals that cannot receive financial help from parents or a spouse/partner.

Forcing people to live with other people well into their late 20’s and up just to get by financially while dealing with the stress of graduate school is incredibly difficult. UCSD’s stipend cannot simply match that of other schools in the country, because in the Midwest it would be easy to live, whereas here it’s barely enough without large sacrifices.

If I were to experience an unforeseen emergency, I would not feel financially secure.

Furthermore, moving further away from campus will not improve the situation because I will spend more money on parking permits and gas, as well as additional time during my commute.
